Wrapper of fna3d-sys

== TODOs

* wrap structs in a nice way..

== Overview

`fna3d-sys` generates Rust FFI to FNA3D using https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen[bindgen]. `fna3d` wraps them in Rust code to makes it handy.

Most functions are wrapped as methods of `Device`.

== Policy

* For `i32` type parameters, use `u32` then cast them to `i32` without considering safety (use of 32th bit)
