= WIP

* [x] enums
* [ ] wrap structs with lifetimes
* [ ] modify sys crate and remove unnecessary `&mut`
* [ ] solve dependency to FNA3D
* [ ] learn how to use FNA3D and improve this wrapper

Wrapper of FNA3D

== Overview

`fna3d-sys` generates Rust FFI to FNA3D using https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen[bindgen]. `fna3d` wraps them in Rust code and makes it safe & handy.

== Policy

* prefer `u32` to `i32`
* use lifetimes
* prefer to modify output of `bindgen` and remove unnecessary `&mut`
