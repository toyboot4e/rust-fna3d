= WIP

* [x] enums
* [ ] wrap structs with lifetimes?
* [ ] solve dependency to FNA3D (maybe copy the binary to output?)
* [ ] learn how to use FNA3D and improve this wrapper

Wrapper of FNA3D

== Overview

`fna3d-sys` generates Rust FFI to FNA3D using https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen[bindgen]. `fna3d` wraps them in Rust code and makes it safe & handy.

== Policy

* assume that https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/raw/type.c_int.html[c_int] has 32 bits length
* prefer `u32` to `i32` in arguments and don't care about input values bigger than 31 bits
* use lifetimes?
