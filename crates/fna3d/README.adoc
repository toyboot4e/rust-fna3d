Not ready.

* [x] enums
* [x] structs and methods with rustic cases
* [ ] I need to learn how to solve dependencies to dynamic libraries and how to bundle it to release builds
** [ ] I need to learn how to do with both Rust-FNA3D and Rust-SDL2 (or should it not be used?)
* [ ] I need to learn how to use FNA3D and improve this wrapper

= fna3d

Wrapper of Rust FFI to FNA3D generated with `bindgen` (i.e. `fna3d-sys`)

== Overview

`fna3d-sys` generates Rust FFI to FNA3D using https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen[bindgen]. `fna3d` wraps them in Rust code and makes it safe & handy.
