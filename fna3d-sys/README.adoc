= fna3d-sys

Rust FFI bindings to FNA3D generated with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen[bindgen]

== Notes

=== Dependency to FNA3D and SDL2

I'm really not sure how to solve it!!

For now, FNA3D should be cloned into this directory (see the README in the root of the repository)

=== The name (`fna3d-sys`)

* The library name (`*-sys`) came from the https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages[cargo book].
* The library name is `fna3d-sys` while the target name (library name) is `fna3d_sys`.
