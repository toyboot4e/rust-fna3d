= fna3d-sys

Rust FFI bindings to FNA3D generated with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen[bindgen]

== Notes

=== Dependency to FNA3D and SDL2

WIP. That should be automatically solved

=== The name (`fna3d-sys`)

* It came from the https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages[cargo book].
* It is different from its library name (target name) `fna3d_sys`.
