= fna3d-sys

Rust FFI bindings to FNA3D generated with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen[bindgen]

== Notes

=== Dependency to FNA3D and SDL2

I'm really not sure how to solve them!!

Maybe Rust-SDL2-sys helps me out. For now, FNA3D should be cloned into this directory (see the README in the root of the repository)

=== The name (`fna3d-sys`)

* It came from the https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages[cargo book].
* It is different from its library name (target name) `fna3d_sys`.
