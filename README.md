# Rust-FNA3D

Wrapper of [FNA3D](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D), the graphics library for [FNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/)

## About

Please refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/rust-fna3d). It's for making a higher-level framework on it; take [ANF](https://github.com/toyboot4e/anf) as an example.

## Status

Close to ready. Remaining tasks:

* [ ] Multi platform support of `build.rs`
* [ ] Or enable using `fnalibs`
* [ ] Bundling the dynamic library to the executable automatically?
* [ ] Publish it on crates.io and make sure it works fine
* [ ] Add more wrapper types rather than re-exporting raw types
* [ ] Add more methods to wrapper types
* [ ] `derive` more types

## Contact

Free free to contact with me. I love _any_ kind of improvements and anything will be welcomed!
